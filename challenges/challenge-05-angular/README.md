# Challenge 05: Blog

This project was developed during the DIO's Bootcamp classes, using Angular version 15.0.2, to practice all the concepts learned on Angular: data binding and two way data binding, routes, components, HTML/CSS, and also Typescript.

In addiction to what I developed in the class, I added some new funtionalities to the project:

✅ The main subject of blog is swimming (I really love this sport);
✅ Global variables were created in environment.ts and were interpolated in TS files;
✅ Responsive layout;

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
